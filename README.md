This project is an attempt to recover Visual Studio extension support for xUnit Test Adapter.
It's currently using hardcoded libraries of the xUnit test adapter taken from the [xUnit VisualStudio Nuget Package](https://github.com/xunit/visualstudio.xunit).
The supported version of the binaries is 2.1.0

The next version targets to retrieve current binaries from Nuget package at installation time.
